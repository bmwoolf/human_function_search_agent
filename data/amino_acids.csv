arginine,amino_acid,"Functions as an intracellular arginine sensor within the amino acid-sensing branch of the TORC1 signaling pathway (PubMed:26972053, PubMed:27487210, PubMed:33594058). As a homodimer or a heterodimer with CASTOR2, binds and inhibits the GATOR subcomplex GATOR2 and thereby mTORC1 (PubMed:26972053, PubMed:27487210, PubMed:33594058). Binding of arginine to CASTOR1 allosterically disrupts the interaction of CASTOR1-containing dimers with GATOR2 which can in turn activate mTORC1 and the TORC1 signaling pathway (PubMed:26972053, PubMed:27487210, PubMed:33594058)",,", CASTOR1",Amino acid metabolism,,"UniProt:Q8WTX7 PubMed:40601142,40601006,40597473,40596988,40596262 Reactome:R-HSA-352230 ","Cellular arginine sensor for mTORC1 protein 1, GATS-like protein 3"

cysteine,amino_acid,"Catalyzes the last step in the trans-sulfuration pathway from L-methionine to L-cysteine in a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent manner, which consists on cleaving the L,L-cystathionine molecule into L-cysteine, ammonia and 2-oxobutanoate (PubMed:10212249, PubMed:18476726, PubMed:19261609, PubMed:19961860). Part of the L-cysteine derived from the trans-sulfuration pathway is utilized for biosynthesis of the ubiquitous antioxidant glutathione (PubMed:18476726). Besides its role in the conversion of L-cystathionine into L-cysteine, it utilizes L-cysteine and L-homocysteine as substrates (at much lower rates than L,L-cystathionine) to produce the endogenous gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (PubMed:10212249, PubMed:19019829, PubMed:19261609, PubMed:19961860). In vitro, it converts two L-cysteine molecules into lanthionine and H2S, also two L-homocysteine molecules to homolanthionine and H2S, which can be particularly relevant under conditions of severe hyperhomocysteinemia (which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease) (PubMed:19261609). Lanthionine and homolanthionine are structural homologs of L,L-cystathionine that differ by the absence or presence of an extra methylene group, respectively (PubMed:19261609). Acts as a cysteine-protein sulfhydrase by mediating sulfhydration of target proteins: sulfhydration consists of converting -SH groups into -SSH on specific cysteine residues of target proteins such as GAPDH, PTPN1 and NF-kappa-B subunit RELA, thereby regulating their function (PubMed:22169477). By generating the gasotransmitter H2S, it participates in a number of physiological processes such as vasodilation, bone protection, and inflammation (Probable) (PubMed:29254196). Plays an essential role in myogenesis by contributing to the biogenesis of H2S in skeletal muscle tissue (By similarity). Can also accept homoserine as substrate (By similarity).
