cytochrome oxidase,enzyme,"Component of the cytochrome c oxidase, the last enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain which drives oxidative phosphorylation. The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inner membrane that drives transmembrane transport and the ATP synthase. Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Electrons originating from reduced cytochrome c in the intermembrane space (IMS) are transferred via the dinuclear copper A center (CU(A)) of subunit 2 and heme A of subunit 1 to the active site in subunit 1, a binuclear center (BNC) formed by heme A3 and copper B (CU(B)). The BNC reduces molecular oxygen to 2 water molecules unsing 4 electrons from cytochrome c in the IMS and 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix (PubMed:22902835).

ATP synthase,enzyme,"Subunit a, of the mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase complex (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) that produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain (Probable). ATP synthase complex consist of a soluble F(1) head domain - the catalytic core - and a membrane F(1) domain - the membrane proton channel (PubMed:37244256). These two domains are linked by a central stalk rotating inside the F(1) region and a stationary peripheral stalk (PubMed:37244256). During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation (Probable). With the subunit c (ATP5MC1), forms the proton-conducting channel in the F(0) domain, that contains two crucial half-channels (inlet and outlet) that facilitate proton movement from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) into the matrix (PubMed:37244256). Protons are taken up via the inlet half-channel and released through the outlet half-channel, following a Grotthuss mechanism (PubMed:37244256)",,MT-ATP6,,,"UniProt:P00846 PubMed:40598871,40580838,40580270,40570323,40564127 ","F-ATPase protein 6, Proton-conducting channel, ATP synthase F(0) complex subunit a"
DNA polymerase,enzyme,Accessory component of the DNA polymerase epsilon complex (PubMed:10801849). Participates in DNA repair and in chromosomal DNA replication (By similarity),,POLE4,,,"UniProt:Q9NR33 PubMed:40599263,40599235,40597865,40596487,40595847 ","DNA polymerase II subunit 4, DNA polymerase epsilon subunit p12"
RNA polymerase,enzyme,"Catalytic core component of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates (By similarity) (PubMed:23748380, PubMed:27193682, PubMed:30190596, PubMed:9852112). Pol II-mediated transcription cycle proceeds through transcription initiation, transcription elongation and transcription termination stages. During transcription initiation, Pol II pre-initiation complex (PIC) is recruited to DNA promoters, with focused-type promoters containing either the initiator (Inr) element, or the TATA-box found in cell-type specific genes and dispersed-type promoters that often contain hypomethylated CpG islands usually found in housekeeping genes. Once the polymerase has escaped from the promoter it enters the elongation phase during which RNA is actively polymerized, based on complementarity with the template DNA strand. Transcription termination involves the release of the RNA transcript and polymerase from the DNA (By similarity) (PubMed:23748380, PubMed:27193682, PubMed:28108474, PubMed:30190596, PubMed:9852112). Forms Pol II active center together with the second largest subunit POLR2B/RPB2. Appends one nucleotide at a time to the 3' end of the nascent RNA, with POLR2A/RPB1 most likely contributing a Mg(2+)-coordinating DxDGD motif, and POLR2B/RPB2 participating in the coordination of a second Mg(2+) ion and providing lysine residues believed to facilitate Watson-Crick base pairing between the incoming nucleotide and template base. Typically, Mg(2+) ions direct a 5' nucleoside triphosphate to form a phosphodiester bond with the 3' hydroxyl of the preceding nucleotide of the nascent RNA, with the elimination of pyrophosphate. The reversible pyrophosphorolysis can occur at high pyrophosphate concentrations (By similarity) (PubMed:30190596, PubMed:8381534, PubMed:9852112). Can proofread the nascent RNA transcript by means of a 3' -> 5' exonuclease activity. If a ribonucleotide is mis-incorporated, backtracks along the template DNA and cleaves the phosphodiester bond releasing the mis-incorporated 5'-ribonucleotide (By similarity) (PubMed:8381534). Through its unique C-terminal domain (CTD, 52 heptapeptide tandem repeats) serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation and termination. CTD phosphorylation on Ser-5 mediates Pol II promoter escape, whereas phosphorylation on Ser-2 is required for Pol II pause release during transcription elongation and further pre-mRNA processing. Additionally, the regulation of gene expression levels depends on the balance between methylation and acetylation levels of the CTD-lysines. Initiation or early elongation steps of transcription of growth-factor-induced immediate early genes are regulated by the acetylation status of the CTD. Methylation and dimethylation have a repressive effect on target genes expression. Cooperates with mRNA splicing machinery in co-transcriptional 5'-end capping and co-transcriptional splicing of pre-mRNA (By similarity) (PubMed:24207025, PubMed:26124092)",,POLR2A,,,"UniProt:P24928 PubMed:40599235,40598610,40597884,40595577,40594998 ","3'-5' exoribonuclease, DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit A, DNA-directed RNA polymerase III largest subunit, RNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1"
helicase,enzyme,"Multifunctional enzyme that has magnesium and ATP-dependent 3'-5' DNA-helicase activity on partially duplex substrates (PubMed:9224595, PubMed:9288107, PubMed:9611231). Also has 3'->5' exonuclease activity towards double-stranded (ds)DNA with a 5'-overhang (PubMed:11863428). Has no nuclease activity towards single-stranded (ss)DNA or blunt-ended dsDNA (PubMed:11863428). Helicase activity is most efficient with (d)ATP, but (d)CTP will substitute with reduced efficiency; strand displacement is enhanced by single-strand binding-protein (heterotrimeric replication protein A complex, RPA1, RPA2, RPA3) (PubMed:9611231). Binds preferentially to DNA substrates containing alternate secondary structures, such as replication forks and Holliday junctions. May play an important role in the dissociation of joint DNA molecules that can arise as products of homologous recombination, at stalled replication forks or during DNA repair. Alleviates stalling of DNA polymerases at the site of DNA lesions. Plays a role in the formation of DNA replication focal centers; stably associates with foci elements generating binding sites for RP-A (By similarity). Plays a role in double-strand break repair after gamma-irradiation (PubMed:9224595, PubMed:9288107, PubMed:9611231). Unwinds some G-quadruplex DNA (d(CGG)n tracts); unwinding seems to occur in both 5'-3' and 3'-5' direction and requires a short single-stranded tail (PubMed:10212265). d(CGG)n tracts have a propensity to assemble into tetraplex structures; other G-rich substrates from a telomeric or IgG switch sequence are not unwound (PubMed:10212265). Depletion leads to chromosomal breaks and genome instability (PubMed:33199508)",,WRN,DNA Replication,,"UniProt:Q14191 PubMed:40599787,40598899,40598896,40598572,40596075 Reactome:R-HSA-69306 ","DNA helicase, RecQ-like type 3, RecQ protein-like 2, Werner syndrome protein"

CRLs complexes and ARIH1 collaborate in tandem to mediate ubiquitination of target proteins, ARIH1 mediating addition of the first ubiquitin on CRLs targets (PubMed:27565346).

protease,enzyme,"Heparin-dependent serine protease inhibitor acting in body fluids and secretions. Inactivates serine proteases by binding irreversibly to their serine activation site. Involved in the regulation of intravascular and extravascular proteolytic activities. Plays hemostatic roles in the blood plasma. Acts as a procoagulant and pro-inflammatory factor by inhibiting the anticoagulant activated protein C factor as well as the generation of activated protein C factor by the thrombin/thrombomodulin complex. Acts as an anticoagulant factor by inhibiting blood coagulation factors like prothrombin, factor XI, factor Xa, plasma kallikrein and fibrinolytic enzymes such as tissue- and urinary-type plasminogen activators. In seminal plasma, inactivates several serine proteases implicated in the reproductive system. Inhibits the serpin acrosin; indirectly protects component of the male genital tract from being degraded by excessive released acrosin. Inhibits tissue- and urinary-type plasminogen activator, prostate-specific antigen and kallikrein activities; has a control on the sperm motility and fertilization. Inhibits the activated protein C-catalyzed degradation of SEMG1 and SEMG2; regulates the degradation of semenogelin during the process of transfer of spermatozoa from the male reproductive tract into the female tract. In urine, inhibits urinary-type plasminogen activator and kallikrein activities. Inactivates membrane-anchored serine proteases activities such as MPRSS7 and TMPRSS11E. Inhibits urinary-type plasminogen activator-dependent tumor cell invasion and metastasis. May also play a non-inhibitory role in seminal plasma and urine as a hydrophobic hormone carrier by its binding to retinoic acid",,SERPINA5,R-HSA-5682586,,"UniProt:P05154 PubMed:40600916,40599769,40599679,40599651,40599649 Reactome:R-HSA-5682586 ","Acrosomal serine protease inhibitor, Plasminogen activator inhibitor 3, Protein C inhibitor, Serpin A5"
nuclease,enzyme,"Catalyzes calcium-induced ATP-independent rapid bidirectional and non-specific movement of phospholipids (lipid scrambling or lipid flip-flop) between the inner and outer leaflet of the plasma membrane resulting in collapse of the phospholipid asymmetry which leads to phosphatidylserine externalization on the cell surface (PubMed:10770950, PubMed:18629440, PubMed:23590222, PubMed:23659204, PubMed:24343571, PubMed:24648509, PubMed:29748552, PubMed:32110987, PubMed:8663431, PubMed:9218461, PubMed:9485382, PubMed:9572851). Mediates calcium-dependent phosphatidylserine externalization and apoptosis in neurons via its association with TRPC5 (By similarity). Also exhibits magnesium-dependent nuclease activity against double-stranded DNA and RNA but not single-stranded DNA and can enhance DNA decatenation mediated by TOP2A (PubMed:17567603, PubMed:27206388). Negatively regulates FcR-mediated phagocytosis in differentiated macrophages (PubMed:26745724). May contribute to cytokine-regulated cell proliferation and differentiation (By similarity). May play a role in the antiviral response of interferon (IFN) by amplifying and enhancing the IFN response through increased expression of select subset of potent antiviral genes (PubMed:15308695). Inhibits the functions of viral transactivators, including human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-1 protein Tax, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Tat, human hepatitis B virus (HBV) HBx, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BZLF1 and human cytomegalovirus IE1 and IE2 proteins through direct interactions (PubMed:22789739, PubMed:23501106, PubMed:25365352, PubMed:31434743, PubMed:35138119). Also mediates the inhibition of influenza virus infection by preventing nuclear import of the viral nucleoprotein/NP (PubMed:29352288, PubMed:35595813). Plays a crucial role as a defense factor against SARS-CoV-2 independently of its scramblase activity by directly targeting nascent viral vesicles to prevent virus-membrane fusion and the release of viral RNA into the host-cell cytosol (PubMed:37438530)",,PLSCR1,DNA Replication,,"UniProt:O15162 PubMed:40595633,40592880,40591237,40586552,40585259 Reactome:R-HSA-69306 ","Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid scramblase 1, Erythrocyte phospholipid scramblase, Mg(2+)-dependent nuclease, MmTRA1b"
